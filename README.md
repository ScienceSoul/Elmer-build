# Elmer-build

### Description

This repository contains the scripts I used to build a parallel implementation of Elmer on a network of Linux machines. To compile the parallel implementation, OpenMPI, BLACS, ScaLAPACK and MUMPS are required. The scripts use GNU AutoTools and therefore they are not usable anymore with Elmer since its build system has moved to CMake.
