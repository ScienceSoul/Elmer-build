# Build Elmer on networked Linux machines

### Description

This repository the scripts I used to build a parallel implementation of Elmer on worstations running Linux. To compile the parallel implementation, OpenMPI, BLACS, ScaLAPACK and MUMPS are required. The scripts use GNU AutoTools and therefore they are not really usable with Elmer today as iyt had moved to CMake.
